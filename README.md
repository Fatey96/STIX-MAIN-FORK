# UNCP-Synthetic-Cyber-Knowledge-Graph
The goal of this project is to synthetically generate cyber knowledge graphs to mimic real cyber knowledge graphs. The purpose of generating synthetic knowledge graphs is to train AI to triage large cyber datasets. Knowledge graphs are represented in STIX 2.1 format.

## STIX 2.1
